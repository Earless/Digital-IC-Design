   This file can be copied into a users home or project directory
   and customized.

   The site initialization file in <cds_install_dir>/local/.cdsinit should
   set all the defaults for the site.

   For more information on site initialization look at the files

      <cds_install_dir>/samples/local/
                                    cdsinit
                                    aaConfig.il
                                    dciConfig.il
                                    metConfig.il
                                    sysConfig.il
                                    uiConfig.il
                             
      

   The sample site initialization file supplied is

      <cds_install_dir>/samples/local/cdsinit

   The site administrator should have moved this to

      <cds_install_dir>/local/.cdsinit

   and customized it.

   Please read the entire file and the comments before you start
   customizing the file.

   There are bind key definition files supplied for different 
   applications. The relevant bind key definitions files must
   be loaded if you want bind keys defined for that application.
   See section LOAD APPLICATION BIND KEY DEFINITIONS.
###################################################################

   The user may copy portions from the above files into the
   home or project customization file and modify the defaults.


   It is recommended that the user copy only portions as opposed
   to copying the whole files.

   Appropriate items for the user's customization file are

   1. Library search path
   2. Specific bind keys
   3. Custom SKILL procedures
   4. User preference options             - examples in uiConfig.il
   5. Form placements                     - examples in uiConfig.il

   In order for any window placements to work correctly the following 
   X resource must be set in the .Xdefaults or .xresources file
   pertaining to your hardware platform.

	Mwm*clientAutoPlace:             False

   After setting the resource read in the resource file with the command

	xrdb <resource_filename>
   
   and restart the Motif window manager.

   The function 
             prependInstallPath("string")
   adds the installation path to the string argument
   For this reason there should NOT be a space at the beginning of the
   string.
   There SHOULD be a space at the end of the string if more paths are to
   follow.
   This function is used to make path specification in this file
   independant of the exact installation path.

   The function let() creates local variables ( example: libPath ). 
   This makes sure that any global variables are not accidentally modified.

;  The function sstatus() sets the status of variables
;  The variable writeProtect controls if a SKILL function can be
;  redefined or not;
;
;  Any functions defined after writeProtect = t CANNOT be redefined
;  Any functions defined after writeProtect = nil CAN be redefined
;  If you are going to create SKILL programs and define functions set the
;  status of writeProtect to nil at the beginning of your session.
;
;  Set skill search path. The SKILL search path contains directories
;  to be searched to locate SKILL programs when program names are
;  specified without full path names.
;  The operation could be reading, writing or loading a SKILL program.
;
;  Source technology files are considered SKILL files and when loading 
;  or dumping the technology file SKILL search path will be used.

; Set your own prompt in the CIW. The first argument is the prompt.
; The second argument is not used yet.
;
; The variable editor defines the text editor to be used when any of
; the applications invoke an editor. For example technology dump and edit
; operation opens an editor window. 
;
; The editor may also be set by 
;               
;         unix environment variable EDITOR
;
;             setenv EDITOR 'xedit'
;
;
; When Design Framework is invoked the SKILL variable editor is set to the
; value of the unix variable EDITOR.
;  
; If EDITOR is not defined the SKILL variable
; editor is set to "vi"
;
; You may also set the variable to execute a UNIX command
; that invokes an xterm window of given size and location
; and starts an editor program.
; Example:
;
;    editor = "xterm -geometry 80x40 -e emacs"
;
; Size of xterm in the above example is 80 characters by 40 lines.
; With some editors on certain platforms the variable editor must
; be defined as shown above.
;
; Some application which require a text editor may be using the UNIX
; variable EDITOR instead of the SKILL variable editor. It is a good
; idea to set the UNIX variable EDITOR to the text editor of your
; choice which will automatically set the SKILL variable editor.
